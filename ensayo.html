            <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin:auto; text-align:center;">Why should you keep it simpler, stupid?</h1> <br>
            <p style="margin:auto; font-size: 1.5rem; width: 80%; text-align:center;">Technology should be usable for everybody, and if it is not, then make it again.</p>
            <br><p style="margin:auto; font-size: 1.5rem; width: 80%; text-align:center;">Since the beginning of technology’s time, every single device has been created with the purpose of making everything just a little be easier. Let’s say, the computers. The first computers were only usable by experts, or people who were really interested in the hobby of computational sciences, due to the high complexity of using one. Therefor, computers weren’t really a good business model. Just few people, and some companies were interested in getting one. However, this changed with the development of the first user interface on an operating system, and mouse, but why did it happen? Why did computers become more famous after adding a UI and mouse to the “computer” concept? Well, that’s because those stupids kept it simpler. It went from a difficult device to use (see Figure 1.), to a simple, user friendly, device (see Figure 2.).</p>
<br><p style="margin:auto; font-size: 1.5rem; width: 80%; text-align:center;">And what? Is that all? Just keep it simpler because people will like it? Well, not really. The “simple” concept has been defined as “easily understood or done”, it means, people will feel more willing to use your project (it could be a web site, a desktop app, a device, or even a building), and why would you want to create something if it’s not for it to be used for someone else? That’s the whole point. If you keep it simpler, stupid, people will use your product or service. Moreover, it is important nowadays, considering how important apps have become on a daily basis, where literally every person has to deal with apps everyday to be able to do simple things, such as paying bills, ordering food, requesting doctor appointments, and so on. Is this the point, when developers should think about elderly, and people with difficulties to use all of these devices. You should also keep it simpler for them, stupid. </p>
<br><p style="margin:auto; font-size: 1.5rem; width: 80%; text-align:center;">But how can you keep it simpler? It is not really difficult, stupid. Taking into account the good design of the modern architecture’s principles, it will basically flow while you develop the project. What principles are those? It is easy, in order to keep it simpler, you should think about the project’s security.  Talking about web development, the project’s security relates to taking into account which users are allowed to execute which methods, functions, actions, or whatever you want to call them. Basically, don’t let a bank’s user modify its own debt. Now, availability, well, if it is not going to be available, why are you making it at all, stupid? On the same logic, if it is not agile, please, don’t make it. By the way, what would happen if you made this project for a hundred people, but out of nowhere you got a thousand users? Basically, this principle is about the project being ok with receiving more users than expected, but of course, it doesn't happen magically. Developers should prepare the web site to be adapted with different servers in order to be scalable. Real time? Yes, you should also make it on real time, why would anyone want to know its doctor appointment has been changed when it is too late? Exactly, keep it real time, so all the information is as accurate as possible. Oh man! You used certain function from a third-party company that was vital for your project’s correct functionality. Well, now you are basically f***ed up. That’s why you should make it independent of any third-party functionality, and even independent from your own functionalities. </p>
<br><p style="margin:auto; font-size: 1.5rem; width: 80%; text-align:center;">Now, how can you be sure that you are keeping it simple enough, stupid? That’s not really easy, nor impossible. Is here when requirements are important. You should take into account that there are two kind of requirements: functional, and not functional ones. On the one hand, functional are basically all of those requirements which have been explicitly defined by the customer. On the other hand, not functional requirements are all of those which are not usually defined by the customer, but you know that they are required to get a good result on your final product. The combination of these requirements, leads you to the quality attributes, being the last ones your guide for simple enough. In other words, simple enough is usually defined for the customer, or the project’s architect. They are the ones who know exactly who will be using the product, why the will be using it, and how they are supposed to use it. Usually this process can go from the hand of a UI expert, who will recollect all of this information. </p>
<br><p style="margin:auto; font-size: 1.5rem; width: 80%; text-align:center;">Finally, remember that the purpose of a IT product (and many other kind of products) is to be used by people, and if they struggle with understanding how to use it, they will hate it. A good way to design something easy to use, is following the principles of the modern architecture. Moreover, you should follow the requirements defined by the customer, and the rules defined by the architect. In other really simple words, you should KEEP IT SIMPLER, STUPID, and at all cost, you should always try to DON’T REPEAT YOURSELF. </p>
